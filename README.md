##How to use

When composer installation is finished you will see `vendor/autoload.php` that is the auload generated by composer. If you have set `mysqltcs` as composer dependence the autoload loads both mysqltcs and other dependecies. So you just have to include autload in each file where you want use mysqltcs and create the mysqtcs object in the following way: `$connection = new it\thecsea\mysqltcs\Mysqltcs(...)`

2. Type `phpunit` or if you have downloaded the phar `php phpunit-xxx.phar`
